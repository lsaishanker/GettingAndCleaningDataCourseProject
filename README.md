# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project In Coursera

### There is one R script run_analysis.R for this project. This script does the following:-
* If the input data set folder is not present in the workspace directory, it will download and unzip the file.
* Read 3 data files(X_test.txt - features, y_test.txt - activity and subject_test.txt - subject) from 'test' folder under 'UCI HAR Dataset/test'. 
* Read 3 data files(X_train.txt - features, y_train.txt - activity and subject_train.txt - subject) from 'train' folder under 'UCI HAR Dataset/train'.
* Combines the respective (features, activity, subject data sets) from test and train data sets.
* Read the features.txt file under 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder. Extracts the rows with values for mean and standard deviation. 
  These values will be the column headers for the features data set. Each column header variable is enhanced to be descriptive.
* Read the activity_labels.txt under 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder. These values will be mapped to the respective activity codes
  in the activity data set.
* Merges the subject, activity and features (mean and standard deviation) data sets.
* Use the reshape2 library to reshape the data and generate a second data set.
* Write the reshaped data set to tidy data set text file.

### There is a CodeBook.md file that describes the tidy data set text file generated by the R script run_analysis.R.
